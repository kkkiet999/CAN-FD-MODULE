# CAN-FD-MODULE
I am using the dsPIC33CK256MC502 to create a CAN FD module for testing CAN FD in my future projects. This module has 3 buttons and 3 LEDs for easy debugging. When building this module, I had difficulty finding an available sample to follow. Therefore, I hope my module will be useful for those who are building a similar one.
